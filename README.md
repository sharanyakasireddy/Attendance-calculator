A web-based Attendance Management System built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. It allows multiple users to securely log in, record classes held and attended, and track their attendance in real time.

The system automatically calculates the attendance percentage and highlights if it falls below 75%, also showing how many more classes are needed to meet the requirement. It features a calendar-based interface for daily attendance tracking.

Built with Firebase Authentication for secure login and Firestore Database for real-time updates, this project functions like a mini ERP system for students and teachers. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development, authentication integration, and real-time database management.
